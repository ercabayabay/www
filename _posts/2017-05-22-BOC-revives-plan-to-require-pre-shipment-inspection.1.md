The BOC’s Financial Service said on Tuesday the figure was 15.6 percent higher than the P90.752 billion reported during the same period last year.

Ten of 17 collection districts exceeded their target revenues from January to March, thereby improving the bureau’s collection performance.

The Ports of Limay, Subic, Davao, and Cagayan de Oro were among the district ports that exceeded their collection targets.

The Port of Limay’s actual take amounted to P6.859 billion, up 4 percent from P6.828 billion target.
 
The Port of Cagayan de Oro collected P3.047 billion, 16 percent higher against the P2.624 billion target.
 
The Port of Davao’s collection was placed at P3.648 billion, exceeding by 15.8 percent its target of P3.151 billion.
 
On the other hand, the 16.2 percent-increase in the collection of the Port of Subic contributed dramatically to the spike in collection performance. Subic’s total collection amounted to P4.271 billion as against its P3.677 billion target.
 
Other ports that hit the target collections:
Port of Clark, P349.1 million, or 14.6 percent higher than the P304.7 million target
Port of Zamboanga, P124.4 million, or 132.6 percent higher than the P53.5 million target.
Port of Tacloban, P61.7 million, or 20.4 percent higher than the P51.3 million target
Port of Iloilo, P677.3 million, or 16.8 percent higher than the P579.8 million target
Port of Legaspi, P151.6 million, or 157.3 percent higher than the P58.9 million target
Port of San Fernando, P749.4 million, or 39 percent higher than the P539.2 million target. 
Meanwhile, the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port (MICP) posted P16.088 billion and P31.947 billion, respectively. Both ports are also nearing their collection targets.
