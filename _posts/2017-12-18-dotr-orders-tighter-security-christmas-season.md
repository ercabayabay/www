Maritime agencies under the Department of Transportation (DOTr) are set to activate this week contingency and security measures to ensure the safety and comfort of travelers during the Yuletide season.

Dubbed as “Oplan Biyaheng Ayos!: KAPASKUHAN 2017,”&nbsp; the maritime sector—composed of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), and Maritime Industry Authority (Marina)—will strictly execute their respective contingency measures from December 20, 2017 to January 5, 2018. The activation of the operation complies with the directive of DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade addressed to all agencies under his department.

>Under the Oplan, maritime officials and personnel are directed to go on heightened alert status to ensure the safety and security of passengers, particularly those travelling by sea to spend the holidays in the provinces.

According to DOTr Undersecretary for Maritime Felipe Judan, maritime personnel are expected to implement several safety measures and contingency plans, such as activating the DOTr Passenger Assistance Counters; ensuring that all ships and other sea vessels are properly inspected; and undertaking thorough inspection of all passengers, bags, and cargoes prior to boarding.

Maritime personnel are also directed to report in real time and provide their superiors regular incident updates via SMS or e-mail.

>Judan further said that they should send a consolidated written report on the occurrence/non-occurrence of incidents through e-mail to their superiors and immediate supervisors daily at 7 a.m.

Authorities are likewise required to send out necessary public advisories such as safety tips, documentation requirements, prohibited items, and safety regulations at seaports.
