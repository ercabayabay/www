In an advisory, the BOC’s Accounts Management Office (AMO) said that effective May 27, those with expiring CPRS will be required to strictly comply with the annual submission policy as provided under Customs Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 11-2014 prior to reactivation in the CPRS.

CMO No. 11-2014, signed May 23, 2014 by then Customs commissioner John Phillip Sevilla, sets out revised guidelines for importers and customs brokers in registering with BOC, pursuant to Finance Department Order No. 33-2014, which extends the application period for those with valid and existing accreditation.

The rules for accreditation form part of the February 2014 directive by the Department of Finance which prescribes a two-tiered accreditation process for importers and customs brokers wanting to transact with the BOC. The rules require that they first seek clearance with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) before proceeding for accreditation with BOC.

Under CMO No. 11-2014, importers and customs brokers need to register in the BOC’s CPRS to be able to use the agency’s electronic-to-mobile (e2m) system, and must submit annual reportorial requirements within 15 days counting from the date of accreditation approval to get reactivated.

For importers, these requirements include the updated general information sheet and company profile; mayor’s permit and proof of lawful occupancy of office; updated list of expected imports, including, if possible, clear description in both technical and tariff terms, including estimate volume and values for the incoming 12 months; and original or certified true copy of renewed BIR Importer’s Clearance Certificate (to be submitted every three years).

For customs brokers, reportorial requirements include updated professional profile; valid Professional Regulatory Commission identification card; updated list of clients with complete address and contact details; list of authorized representatives with personal details, photos, and specimen signatures; and original or certified true copy of renewed BIR Broker’s Clearance Certificate (to be submitted every three years.

BOC can suspend or cancel the accreditation of an importer or customs broker if it finds that the person did not comply with the requirements, or discovers inaccuracies in the documents submitted, the CMO stated.

Latest BOC data showed a total of 12,810 importers and customs brokers listed as active with the agency as of February 5. Of the total, 11,478 are importers, including Philippine Economic Zone Authority locators, while customs brokers represent the remaining 1,332.
