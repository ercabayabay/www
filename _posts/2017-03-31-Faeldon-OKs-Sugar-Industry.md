Seven major groups representing more than five million sugar farmers/workers across 21 provinces in the country and their dependents constituting 95% of the sugar industry signed a Manifesto of Support and a Certificate of Appreciation for Faeldon’s full support of the industry and his efforts to curb sugar smuggling.

The Manifesto and Certificate were signed by Manuel R. Lamata, president of the United Sugar Producers’ Federation of the Philippines, Inc.; Enrique D. Rojas, president of the National Federation of Sugarcane Planters Inc.; Francis R. de la Rama, president of the Confederation of Sugar Producers Association Inc.; Danilo A. Abelita, president of the Panay Federation of Sugarcane Farmers, Inc.; Francisco D. Varua, executive director of the Philippine Sugar Millers Association, Inc., Bernardo C. Trebol, trustee of the Philippine Association of Sugar Refiners, Inc.; and Pablo Lorenzo III, president of Sugar Master Plan Foundation, Inc.

Lamata and Edgardo Lomanog, chief of the anti-sugar smuggling organization, presented the Manifesto and Certificate to the commissioner during a courtesy call at the BOC.

The Manifesto cited the “audacity and courage” of Faeldon, a newcomer in the bureaucracy, as it praised his efforts to run after smugglers shortly upon his assumption as BOC commissioner in July last year.

>“For us in the sugar industry, Commissioner Faeldon has been true to his word,” the Manifesto added, noting that on several occasions, Faeldon was on hand to prevent the entry of smuggled sugar and apprehend the violators.

More recently, the bureau head required importers of high fructose corn syrup to comply with the regulations of the Sugar Regulatory Administration despite tremendous pressure to circumvent the law.
