BOC on Monday, January 16, published on its website and official Facebook page a list of more than 3,000 importers with outdated/incorrect phone numbers or email addresses in the agency’s system. Upon verification, phone calls made to 1,206 importers reveal incorrect or non-working numbers, while emails to 2,365 importers bounced back.

Pursuant to Section 7 of Customs Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 11-2014, failure of the importers to update the Bureau’s Account Management Ofﬁce (AMO) of their updated email address and/or contact details within 30 days from the date of the list’s posting will cause suspension of their accreditation

>Their E2M CPRS access will also be deactivated in accordance with Section 8.b of the said CMO.

Importers identified in the list are required to submit the following documents to AMO:

- Letter request to BOC-AMO for the amendment of CPRS data/information on email addresses and/or phone number/s;
- Print out of importer’s CPRS profile as amended; and
- Print out of VASPS’s email notification of “STORED” CPRS profile.

Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon reminded these importers to inform BOC of their updated contact details to ensure effective communication between importers and the Bureau. “This is one of the ways to better serve the importers, so they should also do their duty by informing us of any changes in their phone numbers or email addresses,” he said.
