In a [memorandum dated April 1][memo], the BOC Port of Cebu district collector said an increasing number of manually processed export declarations has been noted “which clearly hamper the full automation of the bureau”, adding that the 

>“export division has come up with a report on the number of exporters with frequent number of manually processed EDs in 2013 and January to February 2014.”

The memo noted only individuals with personal effects are exempt from the Client Profile Registration System (CPRS) yet “numerous exporters are allowed to manually process EDs with the common reason that their CPRS registration and accreditation have already expired and are still in the process of renewal.

BOC Cebu said the expiration and renewal of CPRS should not be used as a reason to manually process EDs because pursuant to Section 3.2.2 of [Customs Memorandum Order No. 07-2012][cmo], CPRS registration is valid for only a year and renewal should be done 30 days prior to its expiration.

BOC Cebu said exporters will only be allowed to process their EDs manually until April 30. Exempt from the ruling are those individuals with personal effects; those with returned cargoes; and first-time exporters although this requires verification from the Philippine Exporters Confederation.
