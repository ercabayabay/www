Edward Dy Buco, deputy commissioner for Assessment and Operations Coordinating Group (AOCG), and Neil Estrella, director of Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service (CIIS), announced this on Monday after Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon signed Customs Special Order No. 36-2017 creating the SIT.

The SIT is composed of officials and representatives from the CIIS, AOCG, Office of the District Collector, Special Studies and Project Development Committee, Port Operations Service and the Command Center. The team will operate under the AOCG.

The SIT shall conduct examination and submit reports for perishable goods within 24 hours, and for all other goods within 48 hours from the time of the issuance of the alert order in order to fast track inspection of shipments.

The SIT centers will serve as coordinating offices for all alerted and lifted shipments due to undervaluation, thereby shortening the inspection process.

SIT Coordinating Centers are also situated in the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port to coordinate with arrastre operators.

Likewise, the BOC is seeking the support of stakeholders, International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI) and Asian Terminals, Inc. (ATI) in improving trade facilitation and port operations in the country.
